#  WavePortal Dapp Project

Welcome to the WavePortal Dapp project, a web3 decentralized application that allows users to send messages to each other while saving the data on the Ethereum blockchain. This project is designed for developers who are interested in learning about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

This project is a web3 decentralized application (dapp) built using Solidity, Truffle, and React.

Project Overview:
In this project, you will build a website called the WavePortal, where anyone on the internet can send a message to you and save it on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. You will also write and deploy the smart contract, and build the website that allows users to connect their wallets and interact with the smart contract.
