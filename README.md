# WavePortal Dapp Project

The WavePortal Dapp project is a decentralized application that enables users to send messages to each other while storing the data on the Ethereum blockchain. This project is ideal for developers who want to learn about blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.

## Technologies Used

This web3 decentralized application (dapp) was built using the following technologies:

    Solidity
    Truffle
    React

## Project Overview

The WavePortal project is a website that allows anyone on the internet to send a message to the user and save it on the blockchain via an Ethereum smart contract. The project includes building the website, deploying the smart contract, and enabling users to interact with the smart contract by connecting their wallets.

Overall, this project is an excellent opportunity for developers to gain hands-on experience with blockchain technology and learn how to build a web3 decentralized application using the MERN stack.
